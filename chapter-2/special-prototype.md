# Special prototypes

The section [Special Protype](/chapter-2/special-prototype.md "Special Protype") hosts some screenshots taken from the documentation websites of two "special" prototypes:  INPE and OPEN RAMPETTE.

These two projects have this "special" status since WeMake community and staff were directly involved in managing the local co-design and development processes. Both prototypes, INPE and OPENRAMPETTE, are part of a wider activity carried out in collaboration with City of Milan. They included an assessment of the community’s needs and the redesigning of the city accessibility policy, rewired in a co-design process after the underperformance of City of Milan's top down attempt taking place in the previous two years. (see Technical Review for details)

[INPE](/chapter-2/inpe.md) was mainly developed during year 2016, as a result of a cycle of co-design sessions that took place at WeMake, where citizens were invited to describe anonymously - and therefore find a solution - to the obstacles  they had to face on a daily basis and preventing their well-being.

[OPEN RAMPETTE](/chapter-2/rampette.md) was developed during year 2017, addressing the problem of accessibility to Milan commercial activities (stores, restaurants, cafès, exc.). It was carried out as a cycle of co-design sessions, together with citizens and shop owners, with a specific focus on two main aspects: the complex regularization procedure for shops’ accessibility and the inefficient temporary ramp call system.
