# Intro

This document is to be intended as a description of the Deliverable 3.2: Full documentation of all prototypes.

One of the key aims of the Opencare project is to collaboratively develop a how-to guide to document activities in the field or in the lab/makerspace in such a way that documentation can be fed back to the online conversation.

The full documentation of the prototypes developed is publicly released on Github as repositories of the "organization" opencarecc ([https://github.com/opencarecc](https://github.com/opencarecc)).

The deliverable 3.2 is composed of source files, auxiliary design files, bill of materials and list of suppliers, software and firmware, multimedia (photos and videos), instructions and explanations.

Information and updates are related to the actual prototypes developed (stage of implementation, debugging and evaluations, usability testing, executive design review and redesign, engagement of the diverse communities involved).

## Prototype repository

## MicroWebsiteTemplate

An additional repository to mention  is **MicroWebsiteTemplate**:

[https://github.com/opencarecc/MicroWebsiteTemplate](https://github.com/opencarecc/MicroWebsiteTemplate)

A user can find all the code to create a website for documenting an open source project.

WeMake designed the website in order to contain most common documentation elements useful to engage related communities.

All the prototype websites were "forked" from the starting base template.

[https://opencarecc.github.io/MicroWebsiteTemplate](https://opencarecc.github.io/MicroWebsiteTemplate)

The opencare ([http://opencare.cc/](http://opencare.cc/)) website is using the same technical structure  and layout of the prototypes website with a small modification to improve the home page.

## Special Protype

The section [Special Protype](/chapter-2/special-prototype.md "Special Protype") hosts some screenshots taken from the documentation websites of two "special" prototypes:  INPE and OPEN RAMPETTE.

These two projects have this "special" status since WeMake community and staff were directly involved in managing the local co-design and development processes. Both prototypes, INPE and OPENRAMPETTE, are part of a wider activity carried out in collaboration with City of Milan. They included an assessment of the community’s needs and the redesigning of the city accessibility policy, rewired in a co-design process after the underperformance of City of Milan's top down attempt taking place in the previous two years. (see Technical Review for details)

[INPE](/chapter-2/inpe.md) was mainly developed during year 2016, as a result of a cycle of co-design sessions that took place at WeMake, where citizens were invited to describe anonymously - and therefore find a solution - to the obstacles  they had to face on a daily basis and preventing their well-being.

[OPEN RAMPETTE](/chapter-2/rampette.md) was developed during year 2017, addressing the problem of accessibility to Milan commercial activities (stores, restaurants, cafès, exc.). It was carried out as a cycle of co-design sessions, together with citizens and shop owners, with a specific focus on two main aspects: the complex regularization procedure for shops’ accessibility and the inefficient temporary ramp call system.

## Community Prototype

The section [Community Prototype](/chapter-3/community-prototype.md) shows some screenshots displaying the documentation websites of 4 projects that took part in the opencare Maker in Residence (MIR), a special residency programme organized by WeMake  and using WeMake fablab as main location.

Preceded by a Call for Makers, the MIR took place between April and September 2017 and involved 6 different groups of makers (national and international), WeMake staff, WeMake offline community and opencare online community.

During their stay (two weeks long on average) the teams had the opportunity to take part in an intense collaborative environment, exchanging knowledge and expertises in order to improve and accelerate their project.

Among the variety of activities organized during the Maker in Residence, it is possible to list:

* using digital fabrication tools and methodologies

* practising agile planning methods

* receiving feedbacks from opencare network of experts

* connecting with local and online creative communities

* participating and organizing dissemination events

* exploring new business models

* testing and displaying the prototypes to a proactive audience.
