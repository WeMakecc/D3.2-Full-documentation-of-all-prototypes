## CONTENT ARCHITECTURE

Each prototype repository contains:

1. a **read.me** file

    * contains all the essential information about the project

2. **master** branch

    * contains all source files, auxiliary design files, bills of materials and suppliers, software and firmware

3. **gh-pages** branch

    * contains all the **website** source code and html rendered file

4. **wiki**

    * when istruction or tutorial are useful is possible to activate the wiki section. The wiki is easily readable in a browser and can be also easily edited by collaborators of the project.

Github has also the possibility to integrate other useful sections as Projects (to manage task and manage the collaborative work) and Issue tracker (to solve bugs or to develop new features)
