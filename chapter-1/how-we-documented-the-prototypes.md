# How we documented the prototypes

The documentation is following the best practices of good documentation in the "maker communities" (see also the section: Sharing documentation how to facilitate replicability of processes and results of the [opencare Maker Playbook](https://makerplaybook.opencare.cc/).)

The documentation is released using a lot of the features available on Github where many of the open source projects are made public and open to collaboration.

All **websites** are based on Jekyll ( a simple, blog-aware, static site generator for personal, project, or organization sites distributed under an open source license) and GitHub Pages (a static site hosting service by Github).

This combination of a publishing system and hosting makes it easy to:

* keep project's documentation and actual project files in the same place, the repository, thanks to GitHub Pages

* create and publish a variety of content in an easy-to-use language (markdown) and arrange the site layout to match the project's needs, thanks to Jekyll (see also: [https://github.com/opencarecc/MicroWebsiteTemplate/wiki/](https://github.com/opencarecc/MicroWebsiteTemplate/wiki))

* foster contributions by a wider audience
