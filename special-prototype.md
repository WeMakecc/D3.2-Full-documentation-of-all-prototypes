# Special prototypes

The section [Special Prototype](#heading=h.1f8dyni3vnn1) hosts some screenshots taken from the documentation websites of two "special" prototypes:  INPE and OPEN RAMPETTE.

This two projects are "special" meaning that WeMake community and staff were directly involved in managing the local co-design and development processes. Both prototypes, INPE and OPENRAMPETTE, are part of a wider activity carried out in collaboration with City of Milan. It included an assessment of the community’s needs and the redesigning of accessibility’s public policy, rewired in a co-design process after the underperformance of City of Milan's top down attempt taking place in the previous two years. (see Technical Review for details)

[INPE](#heading=h.nmcrqhiptf61) was mainly developed during year 2016, as a result of a cycle of co-design sessions that took place at WeMake, where citizens were invited to describe anonymously - and therefore find a solution - to the obstacles  they had to face on a daily basis and preventing their well-being.

[OPEN RAMPETTE](#heading=h.w1k8tej6jq9g) was developed during year 2017, addressing the problem of accessibility to Milanese commercial activities (stores, restaurants, cafès, exc.). It was carried out as a cycle of co-design sessions, together with citizens and shop owners, with a specific focus on two main aspects: the complex regularization procedure for shops’ accessibility and the inefficient temporary ramp call system.
