# Community prototype

In the section [Community Prototype](#heading=h.7xcdqnd8ulph) some screenshots displaying the documentation websites of 4 projects that took part in the opencare Maker in Residence (MIR), a special residency programme organized by and at WeMake.

Preceded by a Call for Makers, the MIR took place between April and September 2017 and involved 6 different groups of makers (national and international), WeMake staff, WeMake offline community and opencare online community.

During their stay (two weeks long on average) the teams had the opportunity to take part in an intense collaborative environment, exchanging knowledge and expertises in order to improve their project.

Among the variety of activities organized within the Maker in Residence, it is possible to list: using digital fabrication tools and methodologies, practising agile planning methods, receiving feedbacks from experts, connecting with creative communities, participating and organizing events, experimenting new business models, testing and displaying the prototypes to a proactive audience.
